## Intro to Self Driving Cars

### Intro 
This directory includes all of the projects I have completed for the Introduction to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program, which is offered by Udacity. 
In this program, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and techniques related to autonomous driving, and have applied my knowledge through various projects designed to simulate real-world scenarios. 
These projects have allowed me to develop practical skills in areas such as computer vision, sensor fusion, control systems, and machine learning, among others.

#### <a name="project-1"></a>Project_1_Joy Ride
This task requires you to begin writing code that will control a simulated vehicle. 
You will need to send appropriate throttle and steering commands to the car, with the aim of helping it navigate around a predefined test track.

#### <a name="project-2"></a>Project_2_2D_Histogram_Filter_in_Python
For this initial project, I wrote the sense and move functions for a 2-dimensional histogram filter in Python. The sense function allows the robot to use sensor readings to update the probability distribution of its location, while the move function will enable the robot to update its position based on a predefined set of movement instructions.


#### <a name="project-3"></a>Project_3_Implement_Matrix_Class
In this project, I have had the opportunity to apply my object-oriented programming and matrix mathematics expertise by completing the methods in a partially implemented Matrix class.

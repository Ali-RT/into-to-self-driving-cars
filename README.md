## Intro to Self Driving Cars

### Intro 
This directory includes all of the projects I have completed for the Introduction to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program, which is offered by Udacity. 
In this program, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and techniques related to autonomous driving, and have applied my knowledge through various projects designed to simulate real-world scenarios. 
These projects have allowed me to develop practical skills in areas such as computer vision, sensor fusion, control systems, and machine learning, among others.

#### <a name="project-1"></a>Project_1_Joy Ride
This task requires you to begin writing code that will control a simulated vehicle. 
You will need to send appropriate throttle and steering commands to the car, with the aim of helping it navigate around a predefined test track.

#### <a name="project-2"></a>Project_2_2D_Histogram_Filter_in_Python
In this project, I have had the opportunity to apply my object-oriented programming and matrix mathematics expertise by completing the methods in a partially implemented Matrix class.

## Intro to Self Driving Cars

### Intro 
This directory includes all of the projects I have completed for the Introduction to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program, which is offered by Udacity. 
In this program, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the core principles and techniques related to autonomous driving, and have applied my knowledge through various projects designed to simulate real-world scenarios. 
These projects have allowed me to develop practical skills in areas such as computer vision, sensor fusion, control systems, and machine learning, among others.

#### **Joy Ride**
This task requires you to begin writing code that will control a simulated vehicle. 
You will need to send appropriate throttle and steering commands to the car, with the aim of helping it navigate around a predefined test track.
